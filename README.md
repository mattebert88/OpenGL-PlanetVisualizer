This code was written for the purpose of learning how to program in C++ as well as how to display objects in an OpenGL widget within QT. 

The idea is that as planets move in space their path is dependant on the gravitational attraction between other planets which is depentant on the 
distance between them their masses. This program uses the kinematic equations of motion to calculate the movement at small intervals. A planet's 
acceleration is the summation of all gravitational forces divided by it's own mass (Newtons First Law F = m*a). 


The functionallity of the program is simple.

Left Click- Adds a planet upon release.

Right Click- Adds a planet that is fixed in space.

Scroll Bar-
  While Left or Right is Clicked- Makes the planet Bigger or smaller.
  Otherwise- Zooms in or out.

Future Features

-Lines that go from the center of each planet to all other planets to show their gravitational force.

-Ability to change the speed at which it updates
